//! `wgpu` backend for custom Damascene hosts.
//!
//! Most applications should implement `damascene_core::App` and run it
//! through `damascene-winit-wgpu`. Use this crate directly when you are
//! writing your own host, embedding Damascene into an existing `wgpu`
//! renderer, or producing headless render artifacts.
//!
//! The public entry point is [`Runner`]. It owns:
//!
//! - GPU resources: pipelines, buffers, text atlas, and icon atlas.
//! - Backend-agnostic interaction state shared through
//!   `damascene_core::runtime::RunnerCore`.
//! - A snapshot of the last laid-out tree so input arriving between
//!   frames hit-tests against the geometry the user can see.
//!
//! # Custom host loop
//!
//! The runner does not own the device, queue, swapchain, window, or
//! event loop. A host creates those resources, forwards input into the
//! runner, builds a fresh `El` tree, prepares GPU buffers, and renders:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use damascene_core::prelude::*;
//! use damascene_wgpu::Runner;
//!
//! let mut runner = Runner::new(&device, &queue, surface_format);
//! runner.set_surface_size(surface_width, surface_height);
//!
//! // Per frame:
//! app.before_build();
//! let theme = app.theme();
//! let mut tree = app.build(&damascene_core::BuildCx::new(&theme));
//! runner.set_hotkeys(app.hotkeys());
//! runner.set_theme(theme);
//! runner.prepare(&device, &queue, tree, viewport, scale_factor);
//! runner.render(&device, &mut encoder, target_texture, target_view, None, load_op);
//! ```
//!
//! `prepare` is split from `render`/`draw` so all `queue.write_buffer`
//! calls and atlas uploads happen before render-pass recording, matching
//! `wgpu`'s expected order. Coordinates passed to pointer methods are
//! logical pixels; render targets are physical pixels, so pass the host
//! scale factor to [`Runner::prepare`].
//!
//! Use [`Runner::render`] when Damascene should own pass boundaries. This is
//! required for backdrop-sampling custom shaders. Use [`Runner::draw`]
//! only when you are already inside a host-owned pass and do not need
//! backdrop sampling.
//!
//! # Custom shaders
//!
//! Call [`Runner::register_shader`] with a name and WGSL source. The
//! shader's vertex/fragment must use the shared instance layout — see
//! `shaders/rounded_rect.wgsl` (in damascene-core) for the canonical
//! example. Bind the shader at a node via
//! `El::shader(ShaderBinding::custom(name).with(...))`. Per-instance
//! uniforms map to three generic `vec4` slots:
//!
//! | Uniform key | Slot (`@location`) | Accepted types |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `vec_a` | 2 | `Color` (rgba 0..1) or `Vec4` |
//! | `vec_b` | 3 | `Color` or `Vec4` |
//! | `vec_c` | 4 | `Vec4` (or fall back to scalar `f32` packed in `.x`) |
//!
//! Stock `rounded_rect` reuses the same layout but reads its own named
//! uniforms (`fill`, `stroke`, `stroke_width`, `radius`, `shadow`).
