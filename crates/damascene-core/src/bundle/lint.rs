//! Lint pass — surfaces the kind of issues an LLM iterating on a UI
//! benefits from knowing about, with provenance so the report only
//! flags things the user code can fix.
//!
//! Categories:
//!
//! - **Raw colors / sizes:** values that aren't tokenized. Often fine
//!   inside library code but a smell in user code.
//! - **Overflow:** child rects extending past their parent, or text
//!   exceeding its container's padded content region (centered text
//!   that spills past the padding reads as visually off-center, even
//!   when it nominally fits inside the outer rect).
//! - **Duplicate IDs:** two nodes with the same computed ID (only
//!   possible via explicit `.key(...)` collisions; pure path IDs are
//!   unique by construction).
//!
//! Provenance: every finding records the source location of the
//! offending node (via `#[track_caller]` propagation up to the user's
//! call site). User code is distinguished from damascene's own widget
//! internals by [`Source::from_library`], which a closure-builder
//! site sets explicitly via [`crate::tree::El::from_library`] when
//! `#[track_caller]` won't reach the user. Findings only attribute to
//! sources where `from_library == false`.
//!
//! Overflow findings (rect and text) walk up to the nearest
//! user-source ancestor for attribution. `#[track_caller]` doesn't
//! propagate through closures, so a widget that builds children
//! inside `.map(...)` either forwards the user's caller via
//! `.at_loc(caller)` (the prevailing pattern in damascene-core today) or
//! marks itself with `.from_library()` so the lint walks up to the
//! user's call site. Either way the user gets a finding pointing at
//! their code, not at damascene-core internals. Raw-color and surface
//! lints are still self-attributed — those are intentional inside
//! widgets and should only fire from user code directly.
