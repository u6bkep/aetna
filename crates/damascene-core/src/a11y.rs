//! Accessibility surfaces shared by every host arrangement.
//!
//! Two halves live here (plan of record: `docs/ACCESSIBILITY_PLAN.md`):
//!
//! - The *user-preference* half: [`AccessibilityPreferences`], the CSS
//!   `prefers-*` media-feature family as a value the host pushes into
//!   the runtime.
//! - The *semantic* half: [`Role`] and [`A11yProps`], the ARIA-shaped
//!   facts each [`El`](crate::tree::El) can carry (`.role(...)`,
//!   `.aria_label(...)`, state setters). Stock widgets self-annotate
//!   through the same public builders user widgets get. With the
//!   `accessibility` cargo feature enabled, the runtime lowers the
//!   laid-out tree into an AccessKit `TreeUpdate` for platform adapters
//!   and routes assistive-technology actions back through the normal
//!   event machinery.
//!
//! Direction of flow: the **host** detects platform/user settings
//! (media queries on web, desktop portal / OS settings natively, env
//! overrides for testing) and calls the runner's
//! `set_accessibility_preferences`. The runtime honors what it owns
//! (motion policy — see below), and **apps** read the rest during build
//! via [`BuildCx::accessibility`] to make theme-shaped decisions
//! (palette choice for [`ColorScheme`], contrast variants). This is the
//! reverse of [`ColorPreferences`], where the *app* declares wishes and
//! the host negotiates — don't conflate the two.
//!
//! What the runtime honors automatically when
//! [`AccessibilityPreferences::reduced_motion`] is `Some(true)`:
//!
//! - App-driven movement props (`scale`, `translate`) snap to their
//!   targets instead of easing — enter transitions keep their opacity
//!   fade but lose zoom/slide, the toast exit keeps its fade but loses
//!   the sink, tap-bounces disappear.
//! - Viewport smooth navigation ([`ViewportRequest`] flights) becomes
//!   instant.
//! - Scene3D camera retargets (refocus / re-fit glides) snap to pose.
//!
//! Color and opacity easing (hover/press mixes, focus-ring fade, plain
//! fades), the caret blink, spinners, and time-driven shader uniforms
//! stay live: reduced motion targets *movement* — the
//! vestibular-trigger class — not essential feedback. This is a
//! deliberately different lever from
//! [`AnimationMode::Settled`](crate::state::AnimationMode), which
//! freezes everything for headless determinism.
