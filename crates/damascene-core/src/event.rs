//! Event types and the [`App`] trait.
//!
//! State-driven rebuilds, routed events, keyboard input, and automatic
//! hover/press/focus visuals. See `docs/LIBRARY_VISION.md` for the application
//! model this fits into.
//!
//! This module owns the *types* — what the host's `App::on_event` sees
//! and what gets registered as hotkeys. The state machine that produces
//! these events lives in [`crate::state::UiState`]; the routing helpers
//! live in [`mod@crate::hit_test`] and [`mod@crate::focus`].
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use damascene_core::prelude::*;
//!
//! struct Counter { value: i32 }
//!
//! impl App for Counter {
//!     fn build(&self, _cx: &BuildCx) -> El {
//!         column([
//!             h1(format!("{}", self.value)),
//!             row([
//!                 button("-").key("dec"),
//!                 button("+").key("inc"),
//!             ]),
//!         ])
//!     }
//!     fn on_event(&mut self, e: UiEvent, _cx: &EventCx) {
//!         if e.is_click_or_activate("inc") {
//!             self.value += 1;
//!         } else if e.is_click_or_activate("dec") {
//!             self.value -= 1;
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! - **Identity** is `El::key`. Tag a node with `.key("...")` and it's
//!   hit-testable (and gets automatic hover/press visuals).
//! - **The build closure is pure.** It reads `&self`, returns a fresh
//!   tree. The library tracks pointer state, hovered key, pressed key
//!   internally and applies visual deltas after build but before layout
//!   completes.
//! - **Events flow back via `on_event`.** The library hit-tests pointer
//!   events against the most-recently-laid-out tree and emits
//!   [`UiEvent`]s when something is clicked. The host's `App::on_event`
//!   updates state; the renderer reports whether animation state needs
//!   another redraw.
