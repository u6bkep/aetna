//! Flex-style layout pass over the [`El`] tree.
//!
//! Sizing per axis:
//! - `Fixed(px)` — exact size on its axis.
//! - `Hug` — intrinsic size (text width, sum of children, etc.). Default.
//! - `Fill(weight)` — share leftover main-axis space proportionally.
//!
//! Defaults match CSS flex's `flex: 0 1 auto`: children content-size
//! on the main axis, defer to the parent's [`Align`] on the cross
//! axis. `Align::Stretch` (the column / scroll default) stretches both
//! `Hug` and `Fill` children to the container's full cross extent —
//! the analog of CSS `align-items: stretch`. `Align::Center | Start |
//! End` shrinks them to intrinsic so the alignment can actually
//! position them — matching CSS's behavior when align-items is
//! non-stretch. Main-axis distribution is governed by [`Justify`] (or
//! insert a [`spacer`]).
//!
//! The layout pass also assigns each node a stable path-based
//! [`El::computed_id`]: `root.0.card[account].2.button` — a node's ID is
//! parent-id + dot + role-or-key + sibling-index. IDs survive minor
//! refactors and are usable as patch / lint / draw-op targets.
//!
//! Rects do not live on `El` — the layout pass writes them to
//! `UiState`'s computed-rect side map, keyed by `computed_id`. The
//! container rect flows down the recursion as a parameter; child rects
//! are computed per-axis and inserted into the side map. Scroll offsets
//! likewise read/write `UiState`'s scroll-offset side map directly.
//!
//! Text intrinsic measurement uses bundled-font glyph advances via
//! [`crate::text::metrics`]. Full shaping still belongs to the renderer
//! for now; this keeps layout/lint/SVG close enough to glyphon output
//! without committing to the final text stack.

/// Second escape hatch: author-supplied layout function.
///
/// When set on a node via [`El::layout`], the layout pass calls this
/// function instead of running the column/row/overlay distribution for
/// that node's direct children. The function returns one [`Rect`] per
/// child (in source order), positioned anywhere inside the container.
/// The library still recurses into each child (so descendants lay out
/// normally) and still drives hit-test, focus, animation, scroll —
/// those all read from `UiState`'s computed-rect side map, which receives the
/// rects this function produces.
///
/// Authors typically write a free `fn(LayoutCtx) -> Vec<Rect>` and
/// pass it directly: `column(children).layout(my_layout)`.
///
/// ## What you get
///
/// - [`LayoutCtx::container`] — the rect available for placement
///   (parent rect minus this node's padding).
/// - [`LayoutCtx::children`] — read-only slice of the node's children;
///   index here matches the index in your returned `Vec<Rect>`.
/// - [`LayoutCtx::measure`] — call to get a child's intrinsic
///   `(width, height)` if you need it for sizing decisions.
///
/// ## Scope limits (will panic)
///
/// - The custom-layout node itself must size with [`Size::Fixed`] or
///   [`Size::Fill`] on both axes. `Size::Hug` would require a separate
///   intrinsic callback and is not yet supported.
/// - The returned `Vec<Rect>` length must equal `children.len()`.
