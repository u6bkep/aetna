//! `RunnerCore` — the backend-agnostic half of every Damascene runner.
//!
//! Holds interaction state ([`UiState`], `last_tree`) and paint scratch
//! buffers (`quad_scratch`, `runs`, `paint_items`) plus the geometry
//! context (`viewport_px`, `surface_size_override`) needed to project
//! layout's logical-pixel rects into physical-pixel scissors. Exposes
//! the identical interaction methods both backends ship: `pointer_*`,
//! `key_down`, `set_hotkeys`, `set_animation_mode`, `ui_state`,
//! `rect_of_key`, `debug_summary`, `set_surface_size`, plus the layout
//! / paint-stream stages that are pure CPU work.
//!
//! Each backend's `Runner` *contains* a `RunnerCore` and forwards the
//! interaction methods to it; only the GPU resources (pipelines,
//! buffers, atlases) and the actual GPU upload + draw work stay
//! per-backend. The split shares what's identical without a trait —
//! same shape as `crate::paint`, larger surface.
//!
//! ## What this module does NOT own
//!
//! - **Pipeline registration.** Each backend builds its own
//!   `pipelines: HashMap<ShaderHandle, BackendPipeline>` because the
//!   pipeline value type is GPU-specific.
//! - **Text upload.** Glyph atlas pages live on the GPU as backend
//!   images; the `TextPaint` that owns them is per-backend. Core
//!   reaches into it through the [`TextRecorder`] trait during the
//!   paint stream loop, then the backend flushes its atlas separately.
//! - **GPU upload of `quad_scratch` / frame uniforms.** Backend
//!   responsibility — `prepare()` orchestrates the full sequence.
//! - **`draw()`.** Both backends walk `core.paint_items` + `core.runs`
//!   themselves because the encoder type (and lifetime) diverges.
//!
//! ## Why no `Painter` trait
//!
//! Extracting a `trait Painter { fn prepare(...); fn draw(...); fn
//! set_scissor(...); }` was considered so backends would share *one*
//! abstraction surface. We declined: the only call sites left after
//! this module + [`crate::paint`] are the two
//! `prepare()` GPU-upload tails and the two `draw()` walks, and both
//! need backend-typed handles (`wgpu::RenderPass<'_>` /
//! `AutoCommandBufferBuilder<...>`) that no trait can hide without
//! generics that re-fragment the surface. A `Painter` trait would
//! reduce to a 1-method `set_scissor` indirection plus host-side
//! ceremony — dead weight. The duplication that *is* worth abstracting
//! is the host harness (winit init, swapchain management,
//! `damascene-{wgpu,vulkano}-demo::run`) — and that lives a layer above
//! the paint surface, not inside it. Revisit if a third backend lands
//! or if the GPU-upload sequences diverge enough to make a typed-state
//! interface earn its keep.
