    /// it sits under the registry's web-platform row. The *spelling*
    /// deliberately diverges: HTML's own `name` attribute is a
    /// form-submission key, which is what damascene calls
    /// [`key`][method@Self::key], and no platform attribute is named
    /// for the concept itself. `name` was chosen over `aria_label`
    /// because it is what agents reach for first (measured) and
    /// because damascene has no ARIA layer to be labelling. The cost
    /// is this collision with HTML's `name`; the "Not a key, not a
    /// tooltip" section below is the mitigation, alongside the
    /// `aria_label` / `alt` doc aliases.
    ///
    /// Reach for it on **icon-only buttons and graphic controls**:
    /// `icon_button`, an icon-only toggle, a chart or canvas the user
    /// can operate. A control that already renders its own label
    /// (`button("Save")`) needs no name — the visible text *is* the
    /// accessible name, exactly as on the web.
    ///
    /// # Not a key, not a tooltip
    ///
    /// - [`key`][method@Self::key] is a *machine* identity: it feeds
    ///   `computed_id`, is never shown to a person, and is usually a
    ///   slug (`"row:3.close"`). A name is prose (`"Close tab"`).
    /// - `.tooltip(...)` is a *hover affordance*: it has a delay, it
    ///   synthesizes a floating layer, and it requires an overlay root
    ///   (see [`tooltip`][method@Self::tooltip]). A name has no visual or
    ///   timing behavior whatsoever and works on any root.
