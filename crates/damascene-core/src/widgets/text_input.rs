//! Single-line text input widget with selection.
//!
//! `text_input(key, value, selection)` renders a focusable, key-capturing
//! input field with a visible caret and (when non-empty) a tinted
//! selection rectangle behind the selected glyphs. The application
//! owns both the string and the global [`Selection`]; routed events are
//! folded back via [`apply_event`] in the app's `on_event` handler.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use damascene_core::prelude::*;
//!
//! struct Form {
//!     name: String,
//!     selection: Selection,
//! }
//!
//! impl App for Form {
//!     fn build(&self, _cx: &BuildCx) -> El {
//!         text_input("name", &self.name, &self.selection)
//!     }
//!
//!     fn on_event(&mut self, e: UiEvent, _cx: &EventCx) {
//!         if e.target_key() == Some("name") {
//!             text_input::apply_event(&mut self.name, &mut self.selection, &e, "name");
//!         } else if let Some(selection) = e.selection.clone() {
//!             self.selection = selection;
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     fn selection(&self) -> Selection {
//!         self.selection.clone()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Dogfood note
//!
//! Composes only the public widget-kit surface. The widget pairs a
//! caret + character/IME path with selection semantics layered on top
//! via [`Selection`] (an app-owned value, not stored in `widget_state`),
//! covering drag-select, shift-extend, replace-on-type, and `Ctrl+A`.
//! See `widget_kit.md`.
