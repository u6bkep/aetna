//! Anchored popovers — floating surfaces positioned relative to another
//! keyed element or to a logical-pixel point.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! Apps own the open/closed state and render the popover only while
//! open. Compose at the root using `stack`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn build(&self, _cx: &BuildCx) -> El {
//!     let mut layers = vec![self.main_view()];
//!     if self.menu_open {
//!         layers.push(popover(
//!             "color-menu",
//!             Anchor::below_key("color-trigger"),
//!             [menu_item("Red"), menu_item("Blue"), menu_item("Green")],
//!         ));
//!     }
//!     stack(layers)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The popover layer fills the viewport, paints a transparent dismiss
//! scrim under the panel, and anchors the panel via [`anchor_rect`] —
//! which flips to the opposite side if the requested placement would
//! clip, and shrinks the panel to the roomier side when neither fits
//! (the panel then scrolls). Placement stays inside the host's safe
//! area ([`crate::layout::LayoutCtx::placement_bounds`]). Click
//! outside the panel emits
//! `{key}:dismiss`; `Escape` is delivered as a `UiEventKind::Escape`
//! event whose target is the focused element (apps route both to close
//! the popover).
//!
//! # Why explicit composition (no portal hoist)
//!
//! Damascene's grain is "every visible thing is in the El tree at the
//! source location it was authored." A portal mechanism (where a node
//! lives in one place in the tree but paints somewhere else) would
//! subvert clip escape, focus order, hit-test recursion, and lint
//! output for one feature, and force every future feature to think
//! about portaling. Composing at the root keeps the contract uniform:
//! the popover is a sibling of main content, paints last, hit-tests
//! first. See `widget_kit.md`.
//!
//! # Dogfood
//!
//! `popover` is a composition of [`crate::overlay`], a keyed
//! [`crate::scrim`], and a custom-laid-out container that uses
//! [`crate::layout::LayoutCtx::rect_of_key`] to position its panel
//! relative to the trigger. An app crate can write an equivalent
//! floating layer against the same public surface.

///   `--available-height`. The stock menu panels scroll, so the rows
///   that no longer fit are a pan away rather than off-screen. An
///   anchor spanning the whole placement height leaves no room on
///   either side; the panel then overlaps it rather than vanish.
/// - **Neither side fits, horizontally** — nothing scrolls sideways,
///   so the panel keeps the requested side at full width and the
///   clamp below shifts it over the anchor.
/// - **Side::AtPoint** — top-left corner at the anchor point;
///   `gap` is ignored (the point is the placement).
/// - After placement, the rect is shifted (not flipped) so it stays
///   within the viewport on the secondary axis; a panel larger than
///   the viewport on that axis is shrunk to it.

///   the panel lands at the viewport top-left at its requested size.
///
