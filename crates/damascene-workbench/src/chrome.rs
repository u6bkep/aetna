//! The chrome widgets core lacks, styled from the workbench theme.
//!
//! Core already ships the shell widgets an application needs most —
//! `menubar`, `toolbar`, `editor_tabs`, `sidebar`, `resize_handle`,
//! `number_scrubber`. This module adds the ones it does not, in the
//! order `docs/WORKBENCH_VISION.md` names them: a status bar, a chip, a
//! pane header, and the hairline rule — plus, since the 2026-07-27
//! acceptance round measured them as the remaining shell hand-rolls, a
//! [`title_bar`], a [`section_header`], and [`vertical_hairline`].
//!
//! # Names come from the VS Code part vocabulary
//!
//! Per `docs/NAMING_ORACLE.md`, workbench chrome recipes take **VS Code
//! part names** — the only name source that exists for this layer.
//! [`status_bar`] is `statusbar`, [`title_bar`] is `titlebar`,
//! [`pane_header`] is `sideBarSectionHeader`. Where a recipe is not a
//! workbench part at all, its rustdoc says which oracle it does cite
//! (see [`section_header`]) or records that it has none.
//!
//! # Everything here is a stock `El`
//!
//! No new `Kind`, no new metrics role, no core changes. These are
//! recipes: `row`/`column` with workbench fills, per-side borders, and
//! the dense heights from [`crate::tokens`]. An app is free to inline
//! any of them and tune it.
//!
//! # Borders, not interleaved rules
//!
//! The bars here separate themselves with `.border_t()` / `.border_b()`
//! — real CSS-semantics per-side borders, which join padding in the
//! layout content inset. The retired `damascene-carbon` experiment had
//! to interleave 1px filled siblings for the same effect (its
//! `hairline()` had 12 call sites); that workaround is what
//! `docs/VOCABULARY_PARITY.md` §1 was written to delete.
//!
//! [`hairline`] survives anyway, because per-side borders paint on the
//! bordered element. A rule *between* two siblings that neither of them
//! should own — a separator inside a scrolling list, a divider between
//! toolbar groups — is still a node of its own.
